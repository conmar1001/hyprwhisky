# Hyprwhisky
My hyprland config


Pretty simple config using the default hyprland look. I try not to make things too complex.

Everything is located in the .config unless otherwise specified

My neovim config is just nvchad with a somewhat matching theme. You can see nvchads install instructions @ https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install

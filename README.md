# Hyprwhisky
My hyprland config


Pretty simple config using the default hyprland look. I try not to make things too complex.
I use cachyos with no desktop for my base and add all packages after main install.
Everything is located in the .config unless otherwise specified

My neovim config is just nvchad with a somewhat matching theme. You can see nvchads install instructions @ https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install

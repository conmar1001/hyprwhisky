# Hyprwhisky
My hyprland config


Pretty simple config using the default hyprland look. I try not to make things too complex.
I use cachyos with no desktop for my base and add all packages after main install.
CachyOS download @ https://www.cachyos.org
Everything is located in the .config unless otherwise specified

My neovim config is just nvchad with a somewhat matching theme. You can see nvchads install instructions @ https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install

Packages needed are as follows (and any dependencies)
You can run this command on arch and all required packages should be downloaded
